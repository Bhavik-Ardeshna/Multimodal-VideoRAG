[Music]

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.000
on this Hallowed Ground at Bellow wood

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
we are surrounded by the solemn reminder

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.120
of the price of Peace a price paid more

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.360
than 100 Years Ago by Marines answering

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.200
our call to duty to Country and to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.039
[Music]

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.640
court on this very ground we fought

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.640
battles both together and against one

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.199
another in the face of insur aable odds

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.119
our brave Sons fathers uncles and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.799
brothers as well as our sisters aunts

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.159
and mothers laid down their lives to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.560
protect not only our homeland but the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680
very idea of

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.759
freedom they now rest here and we pay

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.880
omage to their Valor

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.010
[Music]

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.720
today our alliance is strong as strong

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200
as it has ever been but threats to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.280
democracy and freedom

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.600
remain we enjoy relative peace here

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.119
today paid for in part by the more than

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.479
6,000 Americans buried

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.320
here but no peace is permanent democracy

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.759
is imperfect

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.960
freedom is

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.200
fragile we are all well aware of the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.320
troubles in the East may we not grow

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.440
lazy or complacent and take our peace

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.160
for

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.640
granted instead let us face our precious

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.480
future head long Embrace a tomorrow that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.040
our fallen will never see with a sense

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.840
of courage and commitment worthy of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.200
their

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.319
sacrifice Viva laf France God Bless
